/*

1. Print N lines (where N is user specified) of the data to the terminal.

2. Calculate the magnitude of each data point, assuming the point forms a vector with the origin (0,0).

3. Fit a straight line to the data using the least squares method, and assess the goodness of fit using a χ2
test (we expect it to be bad).
•Least squares method
•χ2 test

4. Calculate x_y for each data point without using a for loop or any in-built power functions.
5. Adapt the code so that for each of the previous steps, the results are written to a file with differing names
depending on the task chosen.
